            <p>
            One big problem with Cloud9 is that if you had a bad or no internet connection then it would be imposible to use.
            Which of course would make using it very impractical.

            <ol>
                <li>For basic support Cloud9 end users can invite new users to a team and they do not need to provide credit card details on signup. Cloud9 does not need to have access to your credit card info.</li>
                <li>For educational purposes Cloud9 is a good option because it can be provided for $1 per month for each team that you set up.  It doesn’t matter how many members join it. Once they sign up they can use the normal share flow.</li>
                <li>Cloud9 is a low cost alternative to keeping onsite servers up and running.</li>
                <li>Since Cloud9 puts important data and applications in the cloud IT crashes and natural disasters can’t affect your company.</li>
                <li>Cloud9 provides reliable backup, constant availability, and affordable support.</li>
                <li>Cloud9’s automated systems can handle most routine support requirements.  If complicated issues arise the live support desk can provide quick assistance.</li>
                <li>Time consuming and complicated software deployments to end users will no longer be necessary as they can access software directly from the cloud.</li>
                <li>Users can create files and allow other users to access them instead of sending multiple copies back and forth.</li>
                <li>Users and clients can work on the same files at the same time in a secure location and don’t have to worry about working on the correct version of a document.  Multi-user capabilities allow immediate access to a full desktop and specific files.</li>
                <li>Leasing is also available to keep your users on the latest edition of their software at a fraction of the cost.  Cloud9 will provide your users with anytime anywhere access.  They can handle all of the  IT, maintenance, backups and updates that your company needs to operate.</li>
                <li>With secure Cloud9 resourcing your company can stop worrying about updates, upgrades, or security.</li>
                <li>The Cloud9 service provides full desktop functionality in a real-time environment through the Cloud9 user portal.</li>
                <li>Cloud9 can provide hosting services to businesses of any size.  It can remove all of the support and maintenance operations while providing a full server.</li>
                <li>Cloud9’s maintenance and support frees your company up to focus on what’s important.</li>
                <li>Cloud 9 can manage the details of keeping your servers secure.  You will know that that all servers contain virus protection and automatic, nightly backups.</li>
                <li>Cloud9 can provide Microsoft Exchange Email cloud servers that work on computers,  tablets, and smartphones.  BlackBerrys can also be synced.</li>
                <li>Cloud9 can provide Office 365 hosting.</li>

            <p>I think it is a really good expension aftering working on GitHub. GitHub is quite useful since all the teammates have their own branches and all the changes are saved and you can always go back to the earlier versions. Cloud9 is like Google Drive that everyone can work on the same file at the same time. They are both excellent tools for group work.</p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
            <p>I feel that I should apoligize because I am not that good with making good comunication, that being said, I thought it was interesting to work on a website with a group</p>
            <p>It is very cool working on cloud9, making a change to the webpage annd watching the change on the website change at the same time.
            I don't think I have worked on anything quite like that.</p>

            <p>Overall I liked the process. I could see it coming in handy if I were in one location and a coworker, whose help I needed were someplace else. I could take my branch from my GitHub project and crate a Clould9 workplace for my coworker and I to work on together, in real time. Then when the work was complete, problem solved, I could just push the branch to GitHub and merge the changes.</p>
